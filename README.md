# Extreme-Climate-Early-Warning
In order to solve operational repetition every 10 days, my office need to put the early warning status on district level .shapefile, so i use python to do this repetitively in seamless way
Disclaimer: this just automation for extracting data from ECMWF output to district level shpfile, the real computation are in model process, the real thing that ive done are just:
1. labelling specific criteria
2. write it on shpfile
3. export shpfile
4. identify the area/district that need to be warn
